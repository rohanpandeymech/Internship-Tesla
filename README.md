Data Transfer Mobile Application for Battery Engineering Team


This mobile application has been crafted specifically for battery engineering technicians, offering them a streamlined solution for transferring data associated with prototype battery builds intended for testing. 

The application is meticulously structured using the Django Framework, leveraging the power of Python in conjunction with JavaScript and jQuery to provide a robust user experience. 

With over 2000 lines of code, the application operates as a web-based mobile platform, avoiding the need to store data on the device itself. Instead, it skillfully manages data through HTML elements, ensuring security and efficiency. Data is efficiently uploaded to an SMB file store using the SMB protocol.

The impact of this application is substantial, leading to a remarkable savings of approximately 15 man-hours per month, which equates to an estimated $5000 in monthly cost savings.
